Central github.io landing page for Midwest PL Summit.

The Midwest PL Summit is an informal workshop to foster the exchange of ideas and to promote collaboration among faculty and students in the Greater Midwest area. Anyone interested in programming languages and compilers — including applications to areas such as systems, software engineering, and human-computer interaction — is welcome to attend. Our aim is to have a broad selection of talks and posters about ongoing research and any other topics that may be of interest to the PL community. There will be no formal proceedings, but abstracts and slides will be distributed on the web after the workshop.
