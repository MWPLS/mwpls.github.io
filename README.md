<h1> Midwest Programming Language Summit

</center>

The Midwest Programming Languages Summit (MWPLS) is an informal
workshop series that aims to run annually with the objective of
fostering the exchange of ideas and promoting collaboration among
faculty and students in the Greater Midwest area. The intended
audience is anyone interested in programming languages and compilers
and their application in areas such as systems, software engineering,
and human-computer interaction. The workshop typically features a
selection of talks and posters about ongoing research on topics that
are of broad interest to the programming languages community. There
are no formal proceedings, but abstracts and slides are usually
distributed on the web after the workshop.

The workshop is hosted each year by one of the universities in the
midwest whose faculty have an interest and representation in the
programming languages area. Links to the websites of some of the
